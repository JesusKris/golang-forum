## General Information
This project was made as a school project in [kood/Jõhvi](https://kood.tech/) (01.19.2022)

The project required us to create a fully functional forum with backend and frontend using Golang.

We also had to implement a DBMS which had to be SqLite.

**NB! Different source control platform was used hence no commit history.**
